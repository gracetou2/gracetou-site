            <p><strong>John A. Bilowith</strong> was described by folks in the Newark, Delaware Rotary club as a “self-styled renaissance man”. John is passionate for Jesus Christ and desires to use his gifts to serve the Lord’s church and ministry leaders both locally and abroad. He seeks to do this through the use of formational resources and spiritual disciplines, offering pulpit supply to pastors who need a break, all in an effort to help local churches and leaders be more supportive to one another in love.</p>
            
            <p>John has been serving the Lord in a variety of roles for over 40 years—most of that time with his wife by his side—around the US, South America, as well as Eastern Europe and Central Asia.</p>
            
            <p>John met his bride, Susan (a pastor's daughter), when attending college in Western Massachusetts in 1982, and they have been married since December of 1984. They currently reside in Waterford, Maine.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Artistic Vision</strong><br>
            John specializes in imagery of shadow and light. Most works carry a clear spiritual theme, all with an encouraging message. The sale of John’s photographs and art goes to help support this effort.</p>
